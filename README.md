# Single-Layer Perceptron

- The single-layer perceptron has only one neuron. Such a
perceptron is limited to perform pattern classification with only two classes. By expanding the
the output layer of the perceptron to include more than one neuron, we can perform such classification with more than two classes.
classification with more than two classes. However, the classes would have to be linearly separable for the perceptron to work.
